# Customer Churn Predictor

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn using historical data and behavioral patterns. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Project Overview

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses to retain customers and maintain a healthy growth rate.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering to create relevant predictors
- Implementation of various machine learning models
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Deployment of the best-performing model
